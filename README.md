EMIPSï¼šEMission Inventory Processing System
============================================

Installation
------------

MeteoInfo need to be pre-installed. The MeteoInfo and EMIPS can be downloaded from 
http://www.meteothink.org/downloads/index.html. Unzip and copy "emips" folder into "MeteoInfo -> toolbox" folder.

Features
--------

EMIPS (EMission Inventory Processing System) software was developed to create emission inventory (EI) data
that atmospheric chemistry models (ACMs) can be used directly. The main functions including ``Chemical speciation``,
``Temporal allocation``, ``Spatial allocation`` and ``vertical allocation``. 

Running
-------

EMIPS jython script can be running in MeteoInfoLab environment. ``run`` folder of this project
includes an example of processing emission inventory for WRF-Chem and CUACE and the cross-reference
files and profiles can be found in ``ge_data`` folder. 
For the convenience of users, we have designed a GUI for EMIPS.
